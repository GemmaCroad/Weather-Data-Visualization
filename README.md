# Weather-Data-Visualization

Final project for General Assembly Web Dev Immersive course. 


## Project Outline

For my final project I wanted to do something with data visualization using an API. The goal was for the user to be able type in any city in the world and for them then to see the next sixteen days of data rendered on the screen in an interactive format.


## Tools

The tools I used during this project:
- D3.js - This is a JavaScript library used for manipulating documents based on data. D3 allows developers to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document.
- The http://openweathermap.org/ API.


## How did it go?

The project has been deployed to GH pages and can be found [here](http://gemmastiles.github.io/Weather-Data-Visualization/). 

The state of the project on the final morning:

I wanted to do something that challenged me and was front-end based. I was keen on  producing something visually interesting and I wanted to incorporate working with a complex API as I feel 


## Challenges

- D3!!!! I knew it was going to be hard learning something so complicated in such a short space of time, but wowsers..There was a lot of maths involved and radial gradients melted my brain. 


## Things to fix / extra features
