# Weather-Data-Visualization

Final project for General Assembly Web Dev Immersive course. 


## Project Outline

For my final project I wanted to do something with data visualization using an API. The goal was for the user to be able type in any city in the world and for them then to see the next sixteen days of data rendered on the screen in an interactive format.


## Tools

The tools I used during this project:
- D3.js - This is a JavaScript library used for manipulating documents based on data. D3 allows developers to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document.
- The http://openweathermap.org/ API.


## How did it go?

The project has been deployed with GH pages and can be found [here](http://gemmastiles.github.io/Weather-Data-Visualization/). 

I wanted to do something that challenged me and was front-end based. I was keen on  producing something visually interesting and I wanted to incorporate working with a complex API as I feel this was something I needed more practice with.


## Challenges

- D3!!!! I knew it was going to be hard learning something so complicated in such a short space of time, but wowsers.There was a lot of maths involved and radial gradients melted my brain. 
- Choosing to work with a library that we hadn't covered in class.
- There is so much information out there on D3.js, there were times when it was hard trying to work out what was useful for my project. 


## Things to fix / extra features

- I'm not happy with how it looks, so I would like to do some work on the CSS and try and get the radial gradient to display properly (at the moment it seems to start at the top left corner of the path of each chart segment).
- Work out how to append mutliple svg elements so the user can search for multiple cities and the previous data restults stays on the page.
- Work out how to translate the UNIX timestamp into a date that the user can understand.
- Maybe create some sort of dashboard where the max and min temps are rendered using a line graph or bar graph, and then wind speeds and humidity for the current day display seperately on some sort of radial graph.
